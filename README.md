# My Project Repository
**by Gabriela Domiciano Avellar**

This repository contains  my project from the module.

I study at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie).

### Overview üëã

In this project I will analyze and understand historical weather data in Ireland, providing detailed insights into weather patterns, [Met Eireann](https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data) datasets were used to perform comprehensive analyses and generate visualizations that illustrate climate trends over the years and projections for the future. The evolution of climate data, such as temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events, is explored to highlight seasonal changes and variations.


### Installation üõ†Ô∏è
To run the code and follow along, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. One recommended option is to install Anaconda, which offers a free distribution and management environment. It comes pre-installed with all the essential packages and libraries required for Python programming.

 - Anaconda: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com).

 - Pyhton: [Pyhton](https://www.python.org).


The editor I used to create Python scripts: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
